<h2>- Trig Games</h2>

<h3>Game 1: Side Detective</h3>
<h5>Game one consists of finding sin(θ), cos(θ), and tan(θ). The game allows you to enter an answer as a fraction. This makes finding the three trig identities much quicker while still ensuring proper comprehension of the identities. </h5>

<h3>Game 2: Theta Finder</h3>
<h4>This game starts by creating a triangle with the opposite and hypotenuse labeled:</h4>

<h4>It then dipicts a new triangle with the adjacent and hypotenuse labeled:</h4>

<h4>Finally, it creates a third triangle with the opposite and adjacent sides labeled. On each iteration, you are asked to solve for θ. You may enter θ in degrees or radians.</h4>

<h3>Game 3: Random-Side Shuffle</h3+>
<h5>Game 3 consists of three rounds, for each round a new triangle is shown. On round one the game shows iether the hypotenuse, adjacent or opposite. Then in round two the game randomly selects one of the remaining two sides, and round three shows the final side. On each iteration the correct θ value is displayed along with the given side.</h5>
<h5>In this case, the opposite side is shown.</h5>

<h5>You are then prompted to enter the two missing lengths (adjacent and hypotenuse). Your answers are tested, and you may replay this round as many times as you want if you fail. Once you complete this round you are taken back to the menu to play it again, or play another game. </h5>
